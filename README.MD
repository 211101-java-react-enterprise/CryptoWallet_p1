### Necessary Setup

Before running this application it is necessary to first download the CryptoORM_p1 project and install it using maven.

You must also add a file called "db.properties" to "/src/main/resources/" with the following information about the database to be used:
<pre>
url={URL to database here}
username={username}
password={password}
</pre>

Included in the "/src/main/resources/" is a file called "crypto_wallet_table_instantiation.sql" which is a script that can be run on a database schema to set up the database tables and create some testing data for the application.
